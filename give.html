	  In the summer of 2017, Lamplight was an idea. Over the last year, a volunteer team of over 20 people have been committing their time, ideas, labor, and capital to make Lamplight a reality. We have laid plans to renovate the property, incorporated as a certified 501(c)3, created a budget, and studied models of popular education from the past and present. Now, we need your help.
	  <p/>
	  We believe that everyone who wants to improve their life and that of their community should have free access to an education that helps them do so. For this reason, we want Lamplight to be free of charge for all students.
	  <p/>
	  To ensure that our pilot program is independent and accessible, we need to raise approximately $40,000 for food, transportation, learning materials, insurance, and modest stipends for our staff.
	  <p/>
	  Every donation to Lamplight, no matter how small, makes a difference. We prefer recurring donations to one-time donations because recurring donations help us plan more clearly for the future.
